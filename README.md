# Project Title

Fake Oil Company Site!  Let's take an industry that could really use website updates and see what we can do...
Also, the site had a fixed background as drone footage of an oil rig but the file(s) are too big for personal pages :( 

## Getting Started

Found a cool design from an agency and followed that visually.  From a UX/UI perspective; the less clicks the better, right?

### First Section 

Nav bar icon & 'logo/name' are in different sections than the rest of the content on the main page.  Hmmmmmm

```
padding:  &  margin:
```

Spacing each section of the site with testimonials visually looks good.  I think it looks better than those 'waves' on the bottom of some pages.

```
<section> </section>
```

CSS Flexbox is baller!!!  What a great idea, so much better than positon: relative / absolute.  My headache is less now...

## Running the tests

Live Server is great too, I also found out about the Material Theme.  I'm starting to wrap my head around this... I was today days old when I realized why coders used headphones.

### JS isn't working

Why tho?  Called it wrong in the function - a class rather than id.       :(   

```
document.querySelector("#about-us").scrollIntoView({
    behavior: "smooth"
```

## What did I learn?

Javascript is sooo cool!  I've hard many times it's the language of the web but whoa you can do some cool stuff with it.
Ok.  So CSS is much harder than it initally looks but flex and grid are pretty cool.  I love how Javascript can tie-in
with everything to give functionality.  I like the menu hide functionality and scroll to sections.  New window pop-up 
is very cool too!  Less clicks the better...

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS/Grid/Flex
* Javascript

## All in all

Learned alot about positioning elements, content - Stack Overflow is your friend!  Also, be sure to stretch every hour or so.  Keep the blood going.
